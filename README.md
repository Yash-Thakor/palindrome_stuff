These programs help you determine whether an inputted number is considered a palindrome or not. 
A palindrome is a value (number or word) which is read the same backwards and forwards (E.G. 121, 232, racecar, madam)
The programs have been written in such a manner that they do not require neither any user-defined functions to run, nor any for/while loops.
I just made this on a whim, and I'm pretty sure the code can be optimised but I'm still in highschool so suck it I guess.
